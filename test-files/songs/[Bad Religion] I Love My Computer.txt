Bad Religion: I Love My Computer

[Verse 1]
I love my computer, you make me feel alright
Every waking hour and every lonely night
I love my computer for all you give to me
Predictable errors and no identity
And it's never been quite so easy
I've never been quite so happy

[Chorus]
All I need to do is click on you
And we'll be joined in the most soulless way
And we'll never ruin each other's day
Cause when I'm through, I just click
And you just go away

[Verse 2]
I love my computer, you're always in the mood
I get so turned on when I turn on you
I love my computer, you never ask for more
You can be a princess or you can be my whore
And it's never been quite so easy
I've never been quite so happy

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
The world outside is so big, but it's safe in my domain
Because to you, I'm just a number and a clever screen name

[Chorus]
All I need to do is click on you
And we'll be together for eternity
And no one is ever gonna take my love from me
Because I've got security, her password and the key
